# advanced-R-exercises

This directory collects all the codes written by myself when studying Advanced R. It covers exercises from Foundation to Functional Programming, the two big sections that are most relevant to me.

The material of Advaced R could be found online (http://adv-r.had.co.nz/) or in textbook. I used the online version to study and practice all the exercises. There are also solutions of these exercises shared online, but I decided to solve these exercises all by myself without looking at the solution codes to go through the thinking and coding process. Therefore, I might skip one or two questions that are beyond myy capability, and the codes and answers might not be perfect. However, those codes are in the best shape I could generate and able to produce outputs correctly after testing.

There are two types of files, rmd and md, for each chapter. Outputs could be found in the md format while in rmd format there is simply codes without outputs.
